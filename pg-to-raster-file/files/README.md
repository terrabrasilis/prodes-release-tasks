## Data Directory Content

This directory is used by the raster export process to store the generated files.
Each biome's files are stored in a directory and are named after the database they came from.

The lm_bioma_250.gpkg file and the ~/auxiliary_2022/ directory are used to test the results of the export process.
The test_bbox_amz.qgz file is the QGIS project used for these tests.

The grid_brasil_no_data.tif file is used by the process as a reference to adjust all bounding boxes, ensuring alignment between the generated products.
