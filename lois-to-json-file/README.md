# Export PostGIS tables to GeoJson file

The objective is to create a copy of the cropped LOI tables by biome, simpler and prepared for use in the Dashboard Data Model and Dashboard Application.

This process exported LOI tables with geographic vector data to GeoJson and Shapefiles files following a specific data model.

The main process need apply some changes to improve names of LOIs, fix and simplify geometries to guarantee speed up map render.
Using the PostGIS resources like ST_SimplifyPreserveTopology and ST_MakeValid, to simplify and [GDAL/OGR](https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/geojson.html) tool to export to GeoJson, we produce similary files as old approach.

These output files will be used in the PRODES panel map, through the redis API.
More details can be found in the [Dashboard API repository](https://github.com/terrabrasilis/terrabrasilis-dashboard-api.git).

The old strategy uses [mapshaper](https://mapshaper.org/) online and has been abandoned in favor of this approach.

If we need to return to mapshaper, we can use the CLI-based solution described [here](https://blog.exploratory.io/how-to-reduce-your-geojson-file-size-smaller-for-better-performance-8fb77759870c).

No ports are exposed, runs only autonomous job on container starts.

## Configuration

We have some configurations to make this scripts works.

The main condition is to have a schema and a table for each LOI, Local Of Interest, in the database for which you want to generate the GeoJson output files. The schema need has a same name of biome, example: "amazonia", and the expected table names of each LOI is: indi, consunit, mun, uf

Define a directory to store your output files and include a configuration file for the SGDB host that you want run the exportation task.

The data storage directory is used to map to a volume inside the container, see the "Export Settings" and "Container configuration" sections.

See the "Export Settings" section to find more setting options about the export task.

### SGDB host configuration

The "dbconf.sh" script searches for the "pgconfig.exportation" file within the root directory.

If "pgconfig.exportation" is not found, the script will create one as an example.

You need to provide SGDB host settings by editing "pgconfig.exportation".

The setting file example:
```txt
user="postgres"
host="localhost"
port=5432
password="postgres"
```

### Process Settings

The process expects some parameter definitions. These parameters are defined in the "export_tables_to_file_config.sh" script and have default values, they are:

```sh
# Used as a database name suffix. Consider that the default database name is prodes_<biome>_nb_p<BASE_YEAR>
BASE_YEAR="2023"
#
# Set the output directory (is mapped inside the container after run)
BASE_PATH_DATA="/main/storage/exported/files"
#
# Fix geometries before export
FIX_GEOM="no"
# Fix UC names before export
FIX_UCS="yes"
# the table name of UCs into each PRODES database
UC_TABLE_NAME="consunit"
#
# we expect that default column name for geometries of LOI is "geom"
LOI_GEOM_COLUMN="geom"
# we expect that default column name for names of LOI is "name"
LOI_NAME_COLUMN="name"
#
# to read the tables or views from selected schema
TABLE_TYPE='BASE TABLE'
#TABLE_TYPE='VIEW'
#
# list of biomes as fraction of target database name. Consider that the default database name is prodes_<biome>_nb_p<BASE_YEAR>
# PRODES_DBS=("pampa" "caatinga" "pantanal" "mata_atlantica" "cerrado" "amazonia" "amazonia_legal")
PRODES_DBS=("mata_atlantica")
```

If you need to change these values, edit the "export_tables_to_file_config.sh" file inside the "lois-to-json-file/" directory on repository root.

### Container configuration

The exportation task need a directory to use as a docker volume where output data is written.

Adjust the path in the "run-pg-export-to-file.sh", using the VOLUME_HOST if necessary.
```sh
VOLUME_HOST="/main/storage/exported/files"
```

If VOLUME_HOST is empty, the default is to use the current directory to store the output files.
For raster option the output is located inside "pg-to-raster-file/" otherwise if it is vector then the locations are "lois-to-json-file/"

## Manual container run

Before running, read the "Container configuration" session.

Using canonical form.
```sh
# Call the script passing the type of exportation and command to docker:
# - "vector" or "raster" or "json"
# - "up" or "down"
# for this process
./run-pg-export-to-file.sh json up
```
